                        I love programming. I can code for 16 hours every day and it doesn't bother me. I realized that if you want to choose a
                        career that you love, it has to be programming.

                <p>It’s time to get serious about improving your programming skills. Let’s do it!
                That’s an easy career improvement goal to give oneself, but “become a kick-ass programmer” is not a simple goal. For one
                thing, saying, “I want to get better” assumes that you recognize what “better” looks like. Plus, too many people aim for
                improvement without any sense of how to get there.</p>
